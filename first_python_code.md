# Your first python code

## Objective
Write your very first python code

## Prerequisite

- Your very first code lecture

## What do you need to complete this exercise?

You can perform this exercise in any Python IDE, including JupyterLab or Google Colab.
I recommend using PyCharm by JetBrains. As a Miramar College student, you are eligible for a free license for the JetBrains IDE environment. 
Please follow my video tutorial on how to download and install PyCharm Professional. 

### 1. Your first code

a. Print the following statements using multiple ```print()``` statements 
```
All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players: 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
```

b. Print the above statements using a single ```print()``` statement

c. Without coding, what is the output of the following statement:
```print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")```

d. Identify a situation where you have to print data with ```flush=True``` and ```flush=False```.
