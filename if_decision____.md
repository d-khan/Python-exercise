# Decision statements

To execute or not to execute—that is the question. I have adapted a Shakespeare quote, originally written as "To be, or not to be—that is the question." Decision statements generally work in a similar way. You evaluate an expression, and if the result is true, you perform a specific action; otherwise, you take a different action.

## Objective

1. Understand how decision statements are applied in Python
2. Skilled in troubleshooting techniques.

## Prerequisite

- Input functions
- Python literals
- Programming variables

## What do you need to complete this exercise?

You can perform this exercise in any Python IDE, including JupyterLab or Google Colab.
I recommend using PyCharm by JetBrains. As a Miramar College student, you are eligible for a free license for the JetBrains IDE environment. 
Please follow my video tutorial on how to download and install PyCharm Professional. 

### 1. Comparison operators
Decision statements use comparison operators and based on the True or False result, the specific statements are executed

```python
print(2 < 5)  # this gives True
print(10 <= 10)  # this gives True
x = 10 
print(20 < x)  # this gives False
print("A" < "a")  # this gives True because the ASCII of "A" is 65 and "a" is 97. The Python interpreter converts the
# character in ASCII number and then compare.
print("Monday" > "Tuesday")  # this gives False because the first character of "Monday" (M) has a lower ASCII value
# as compared to the first character of "Tuesday" (T)
```

Research and find the ASCII number of all the characters available on the keyboard.

### 2. Decision statements

> Find the largest two integers

```python
# Read two numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Choose the larger number
if number1 > number2:
    larger_number = number1
else:
    larger_number = number2

# Print the result
print("The larger number is:", larger_number)

```


### 3. Memory map


### 4. Problem-solving
a. Write a code that takes number of years as input, calculates and prints the number of hours and minutes.  

b. Write a code

### 5. Troubleshooting
Please troubleshoot the following issue **without using Python**, and explain your reasoning.

## Challenges
