# User input using input() function

## Objective

1. Understand how ```input()``` function is applied.

## Prerequisite

- Python literals
- Variables

## What do you need to complete this exercise?

You can perform this exercise in any Python IDE, including JupyterLab or Google Colab.
I recommend using PyCharm by JetBrains. As a Miramar College student, you are eligible for a free license for the JetBrains IDE environment. 
Please follow my video tutorial on how to download and install PyCharm Professional. 

### 1. User input
a. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of a person in kilograms and outputs the equivalent weight in pounds. (Note that 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds).

b. Interest on a credit card's unpaid balance is calculated using the average daily balance. Suppose that $netBalance$ is the balance shown in the bill, $payment$ is the payment made, $d1$ is the number of days in the billing cycle, and $d2$ is the number of days payment is made before biling cycle. Then, the average daily balance is: $averageDailybalance = (netBalance \times d1 - payment \times d2) / d1$.

If the interest rate per month is, say, 0.0152, then the interest on the unpaid balance is: $interest = averageDailyBalance * 0.0152$

Write a program that accepts as input $netBalance$, $payment$, $d1$, $d2$, and $interest rate per month$. The program outputs the interest.
