# Your first python code

## Objective
Write your very first python code

## Prerequisite

- Your very first code lecture

## What do you need to complete this exercise?

- Please follow my video tutorial [installing Python and PyCharm CE on Windows](https://youtu.be/nFN0JW43GKY). Note: The version you see may differ slightly from what is shown in the video.
- Use the PyCharm IDE to write and compile your code. Submit your responses in a Markdown file on GitHub. Ensure that all code included in the Markdown file runs without errors. Refer to [Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/share/F4rK6ZABMXlRn4aGlZ9P005e-iRKwq8rr9KuawDoJ77TdkybKU2tpf4l4QSe113g.ut4jpVaqaPY0oI7b?startTime=1725121532000) for detailed instructions.

### 1. Your first code

a. Print the following statements using multiple ```print()``` statements 
```
All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players: 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
```

b. Print the above statements using a single ```print()``` statement

c. Without coding, what is the output of the following statement:
```print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")```

d. Identify a situation where you have to print data with ```flush=True``` and ```flush=False```.

e. By default, the ```flush``` is disabled but ```print()``` output behaves like ```flush=True```. Which argument triggers the flush?
